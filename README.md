# Multiple-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to predict multiple diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and logistic regression models. The prediction tool is implemented as a Streamlit web application.

# Introduction
Healthcare is an area where predictive modeling can significantly contribute to early diagnosis and treatment of diseases. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of certain diseases based on input features such as medical history, demographic information, and physiological parameters.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda (Spyder)

# Models Used
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Logistic Regression

# Deployment
The application is deployed using Streamlit Cloud, making it accessible via a web browser. Users can interact with the application and input their data to obtain predictions for the aforementioned diseases.

# Instructions
To run this application locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Anaconda installed.
3. Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
4. Open Spyder from Anaconda Navigator or command line.
5. Open the Streamlit app file (Multiple_disease.py) in Spyder.
6. Run the Streamlit app.
